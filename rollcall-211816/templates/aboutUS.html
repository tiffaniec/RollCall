  <h1>About Us</h1>
  <p>
    We are four girls who participated in a 7-week summer immersion program with Girls Who Code at Twitter. We were inspired by the ever developing world of technology and dove into computer science. We believe that computer science will provide our future with endless possibilities and innovation.
  </p>
    As our final project, we were inspired by the hassle of finding who’s in your class and spam of schedules during back to school season. That’s the purpose of this website. By inputting your schedule and name, our database will output the people who have put in their schedule and are in the same class as you. With this website we hope to make finding classmates easier and alleviate some of the ending-summer stress.
