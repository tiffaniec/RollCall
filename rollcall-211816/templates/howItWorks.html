        First, make sure you sign in/sign up.
        <br>
        This allows us to keep track of your information and allows you to come back and edit your schedule if necessary.
        <br>
        <br>
        [space holder for front sign in page]

      <div>
        <br>
        On the input page, you enter your schedule and teachers according to the period.
        <br>
        It is important that you enter those exactly as you see it on your schedule.
        <br>
        [ ie. English 11 H & Waller ,E ]
        <br>
        Then, click submit to input your classes and teachers.
        <br>
        From there, your information is run through our database and compared to other student's data.
        <br>

      <div>
        After you've inputed your schedule, your account is updated with your new schedule.
        <br>
        You will see your schedule appear.

      <br>
      <div>
        When you click on the down arrow, a list of your classmates will appear with their graduating year.
        <br>
        The classmates you see depend on the number of people who have contributted to the database.
        <br>
        Meaning, we only show the data that we have and if no one has inputed that as their course with that teacher, no one will show up as a classmate.
